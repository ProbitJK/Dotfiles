Some keybindings have been changed/disabled so read the configs before using them. Also, I have been unable to get keyboard-state widgets to work for some reason. The LaTeX plugins in neovim will work only if you have LaTeX installed.

Some other applications that I am using that might interest you are Zotero (for
keeping track of papers read), Anaconda (for python/scientific computing),
ani-cli (to watch anime), manga-cli (to read manga), Joplin (note-taking app
with markdown and LaTeX support).
#### Note: Lots of the config files are frankensteins of multiple configs that I have found on reddit/github so expect a lot of garbage!
