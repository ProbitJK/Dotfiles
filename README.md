# Dotfiles for my Sway + Waybar rice
[What my rice looks like](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52576045/201164126-0aa81144-7bc5-4ee6-b1ea-885b566a1869.png)
* Theme: Catppuccin theme as much as possible.
* Terminal emulator: Alacritty
* Editor: Neovim (with lots of plugins)
* File manager: ranger (image previews don't work)
* Prompt: Starship
* PDF reader: Zathura + Okular (when I need to annotate stuff)
* Font: Mononoki Nerd Font
* Shell: Bash
* Screenshot tool: Grim + Slurp
* Lock: Swaylock
* Brightness control: Light
* Notification manager: SwayNotificationCenter
* Menu: dmenu (native wayland options are probably better but I am used to this)
* Music/Videos: mpv + yt-dlp
* Image viewer: feh

Some of the keybindings have been changed/disabled so read the configs before using them. Also, I have been unable to get waybar tray and keyboard-state widgets to work for some reason.
The LaTeX plugins in neovim will work only if you have LaTeX installed.
Some other applications that I am using that might interest you are Zotero (for keeping track of papers read), Anaconda (for python/scientific computing), ani-cli (to watch anime), manga-cli (to read manga), Joplin (note taking app with markdown and LaTeX support).
#### Note: Lots of the config files are frankensteins of multiple configs that I have found on reddit/github so expect a lot of garbage!
