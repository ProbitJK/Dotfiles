# Dotfiles for my Sway + Waybar rice

![Preview of the rice](preview.png?raw=true "Preview of the rice title")

* Theme: Catppuccin theme as much as possible.
* Terminal emulator: Alacritty
* Editor: Neovim (ported setting to Lua, now things look even better)
* File manager: ranger (image previews don't work)
* Prompt: Starship
* PDF reader: Zathura + Okular (when I need to annotate stuff)
* Font: Mononoki Nerd Font
* Shell: Bash
* Screenshot tool: Grim + Slurp
* Lock: Swaylock
* Brightness control: Light + gammastep
* Notification manager: SwayNotificationCenter
* Menu: dmenu (native wayland options are probably better, but I am used to this)
* Music/Videos: mpv + yt-dlp
* Image viewer: feh

Some keybindings have been changed/disabled so read the configs before using them. Also, I have been unable to get keyboard-state widgets to work for some reason. The LaTeX plugins in neovim will work only if you have LaTeX installed.

Some other applications that I am using that might interest you are Zotero (for
keeping track of papers read), Anaconda (for python/scientific computing),
ani-cli (to watch anime), manga-cli (to read manga), Joplin (note-taking app
with markdown and LaTeX support).
#### Note: Lots of the config files are frankensteins of multiple configs that I have found on reddit/github so expect a lot of garbage!
