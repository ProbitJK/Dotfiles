* To convert a markdown file to pdf then simply use

pandoc -V geometry:margin=0.75in source/input.md -o destination/output.md

The '-V geometry:margin=0.75in' is an additional flag that is not mandatory but will make the margins of the pdf produced look tolerable.

* To convert a .md file to a beamer presentation then use

pandoc -t beamer source/input.md -o destination/output.md
